            The website The Journey is all about taking care of one's mental health through self-care. Self-care is taking the time to do things that help you live well and improve your physical and 
        mental health. The Journey provides the space to establish and track your mood and practice mindfulness through journaling and planning your goals. Depending on your specific mood, 
        the Journey provides local resources in Boone, North Carolina. The Journey is made for any and everyone with a focus on the Boone community.
